# Sound Physics Fabric

**!!! REQUIRES Cloth Config !!!**

Sound Physics Fabric is a Minecraft mod that uses efficient ray tracing to calculate realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks. It is fully configurable and new features are being developed all the time. Sound Physics Fabric also integrates with the [Plasmo Voice](https://github.com/plasmoapp/plasmo-voice) mod for the ultimate immersive voice chat experience. I encourage you to share your favourite config [here](https://github.com/vlad2305m/Sound-Physics-Fabric/discussions/2) for me to create config presets for the mod.

Ported to 1.17 fabric and maintained by vlad2305m, featuring some improvements and contributions by daipenjer and thedocruby.
