# Sound-Physics

**!!! REQUIRES Cloth Config !!!**

A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks. (By the means of cheap ray tracing)
Integrates with the [Plasmo Voice](https://github.com/plasmoapp/plasmo-voice) mod for the ultimate immersive voice chat experience.

Ported to 1.17 fabric by vlad2305m, featuring some improvements by daipenjer and thedocruby.

Feel free to share your favourite config [here](https://github.com/vlad2305m/Sound-Physics-Fabric/discussions/2) for me to create config presets.
