> A New Minecraft mod that provides realistic audio physics using parallel wave tracing and an improved physics algorithm.

**Resounding** is the evolution of sound in Minecraft. It uses real audio physics and multithreadded wave tracing techniques to add highly immersive sound modulation to the game. Resounding aims to surpass previous attempts by using enhanced algorithms and new techniques, for a unique audio experience that is both performant and immersive. Planned features include physically accurate reverb, Directional wave reflections, Physically-based bounce fractioning and occlusion, Configurable material properties, Doppler shift, Voice chat integration, and so much more. After Resounding, Minecraft will never sound the same again.<br>

This mod is built to be a client-side Fabric mod. Every part of the mod is fully configurable, and it is all is completely compatible with vanilla gameplay, including custom resource packs. However, support for other mods is not guaranteed.

### NOTE: Resounding is currently in ALPHA. Critical bugs and missing features are expected. For more information see [this page](https://github.com/thedocruby/resounding/wiki/FAQ#what-are-resounding-alpha-versions).
